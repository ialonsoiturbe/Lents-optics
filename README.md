# Lents-optics
How the rays pass trough an optic lent. <br \>
In this program we will see the angles and inclinations of different light rays that pass trough an optic lent. <br \>
We give values to the high "h" the ray enters the lengh with and the program calculates the inclination of the ray post lent. <br \>
